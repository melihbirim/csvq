**The analytical CSV query engine for AI agents.**

Run SQL analytics — `GROUP BY`, aggregates, joins, time-series — on CSV files **in place**: no database, no import, no ingest. csvql ships as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, so an LLM can query a gigabyte file for a few hundred tokens instead of pasting it (impossible) into context. A single static binary written in Zig. Your data never leaves your machine.

> A database is something you load your data *into*. csvql is a query you run on the data where it already lives.

**Read-only and on-prem by design.** csvql only runs `SELECT` — it has no `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`DROP` and physically cannot modify your data. It makes zero network calls, needs no cloud, and runs fully air-gapped. **Our next north star:** the safe way to give AI agents query access to corporate data — run csvql *next to the data* on your own servers (read-only, nothing leaves the box) instead of shipping files out to an LLM.

### Token economics: query files instead of pasting them

Pasting a 417 MB CSV into an LLM costs **230 million tokens** — it fits no context window. Over MCP, the agent queries the file in place and gets back only the answer:

| Question an agent asks | Tokens used |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| *"How many trips per cab type?"* | **43** |
| *"Which year was busiest?"* | **49** |
| *"Average fare by passenger count?"* | **123** |

Same answers, **~1,000–500,000× fewer tokens** — flat, regardless of file size. One command wires it into Claude: [`csvql install`](#setup). Measure it yourself: [`bench/bench_tokens.py`](bench/bench_tokens.py).

```bash
$ csvql "SELECT cab_type, COUNT(*) FROM 'trips.csv' GROUP BY cab_type"
cab_type,COUNT(*)
green,32447
yellow,967553
  0.05s — no import, queried straight off the file
```

---

## Quick Start

csvql auto-detects SQL or simple mode from your input:

```bash
# SQL mode
csvql "SELECT name, salary FROM 'data.csv' WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10"

# Simple mode — same query, shorter syntax
csvql data.csv "name,salary" "age>30" 10 "salary:desc"

# Just browse a file
csvql data.csv
```

### Unix Pipes

```bash
cat data.csv | csvql "SELECT name, age FROM '-' WHERE age > 25"
csvql "SELECT * FROM 'data.csv' WHERE status = 'active'" > output.csv
csvql "SELECT email FROM 'users.csv'" | wc -l
```

### Flags

| Flag                 | Short | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--no-header`        |       | Suppress header row in output                       |
| `--no-input-header`  |       | Treat the first row as data; auto-name columns `c1`..`cN` |
| `-o`, `--output <file>` |    | Write results to a file instead of stdout           |
| `--delimiter <char>` | `-d`  | Field delimiter (default `,`). Use `\t` for TSV     |
| `--json`             |       | Output as a JSON array (`[{...}, ...]`)             |
| `--jsonl`            |       | Output as JSONL / NDJSON (one JSON object per line) |
| `--threads <N>`      |       | Worker threads for parallel execution; `0` uses automatic detection |
| `--strict`           |       | Error on a WHERE numeric comparison against a non-numeric value instead of silently skipping that row (see [CORRECTNESS.md](CORRECTNESS.md#strict-and-exit-codes)) |
| `--version`          | `-v`  | Show version                                        |
| `--help`             | `-h`  | Show help                                           |
| `--mcp`              |       | Start as an MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC transport)   |
| `--root <dir>`       |       | Confine file access to a directory (repeatable via commas) |
| `--audit <file>`     |       | Append a JSONL audit record per query (timestamp, SQL)     |

```bash
# TSV file
csvql "SELECT name, salary FROM 'data.tsv'" -d $'\t'

# Pipe into another tool that expects no header
csvql "SELECT name, age FROM 'data.csv'" --no-header | awk -F, '{print $2}'

# TSV input, no header in output
cat data.tsv | csvql "SELECT * FROM '-'" -d $'\t' --no-header
```

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install melihbirim/csvql/csvql
```

Or in two steps if you plan to install multiple tools from this tap:

```bash
brew tap melihbirim/csvql
brew install csvql
```

> `melihbirim/csvql` is the tap (the formula repository), and the trailing `/csvql` is the formula name inside it.

```

## Performance

**Two fixture sizes, unquoted CSV, Apple M2 Pro**, both engines reading the raw file. Small files are timed as the mean of 30 runs because a single run finishes faster than a shell timer can resolve.

**2M rows, 69 MB:**

| Query | csvql | DuckDB | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `COUNT(*)` | **0.0139s** | 0.1185s | **8.5x** |
| `COUNT(*) WHERE age > 30` | **0.0134s** | 0.1170s | **8.7x** |
| `SUM(salary), AVG(salary)` | **0.0180s** | 0.1178s | **6.5x** |

At this size process startup is a visible share of both totals: 0.022s for DuckDB, 0.005s for csvql. Subtracting it, `COUNT(*)` is 10.5x rather than 8.5x, so these figures understate rather than flatter.

**20M rows, 711 MB** (best-of-5):

| Query                                   | csvql      | DuckDB | Speedup   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| `COUNT(*) GROUP BY department`          | **0.098s** | 0.484s | **4.9x**  |
| `COUNT(*) WHERE age > 30 GROUP BY`      | **0.102s** | 0.506s | **5.0x**  |
| `SELECT DISTINCT city`                  | **0.090s** | 0.494s | **5.5x**  |
| `SUM(salary), AVG(salary) GROUP BY`     | **0.132s** | 0.540s | **4.1x**  |
| `MEDIAN(salary) GROUP BY department`    | 2.832s     | **0.580s** | **0.2x** |

The last row is a real loss, not a rounding artefact: `MEDIAN` buffers every value in a group, so its memory and time are O(rows) rather than O(groups) ([#205](https://github.com/melihbirim/csvql/issues/205)).

**Quoting changes the picture; column count does not.** csvql skips 16 bytes at a time whenever no delimiter, newline or quote is present, and a quoted field disables that. Same files, ~200-byte rows, differing only in whether one column is quoted, `COUNT(*)` with a `WHERE`, 12 threads:

| Columns | Quoting | csvql | DuckDB | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | unquoted | **0.026s** | 0.170s | **6.5x** |
| 2 | quoted | 0.084s | 0.136s | 1.6x |
| 8 | unquoted | **0.040s** | 0.240s | **6.0x** |
| 8 | quoted | 0.116s | 0.236s | 2.0x |
| 32 | unquoted | **0.080s** | 0.458s | **5.7x** |
| 32 | quoted | 0.196s | 0.384s | 2.0x |

The speedup is steady across a sixteen-fold range of column counts. Quoting is the variable that matters, costing roughly 3x.

Faster on every shape measured here, and dramatically faster on machine-generated CSV, which mostly does not quote. Reproduce with [`bench/bench_scaling.sh`](bench/bench_scaling.sh). Why, and the work in progress: [The Journey to 10x DuckDB](https://melihbirim.github.io/csvql/blog/journey-to-10x-duckdb-csv.html).

**As a library, against polars 2.0 and DuckDB.** One query per process so nothing is cached between calls, engines interleaved round by round, first round discarded because it pays for page cache. polars is driven through `scan_csv` (lazy), which is its recommended path for a file on disk and the faster of its two APIs on every shape here. 20M rows / 711 MB, median of 5:

| Query shape | csvql | polars 2.0 | DuckDB | vs polars | vs DuckDB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SUM(salary)` | **0.0807** | 0.2268 | 0.3716 | **2.8x** | **4.6x** |
| `COUNT(*) GROUP BY department` | **0.1241** | 0.3173 | 0.4978 | **2.6x** | **4.0x** |
| `COUNT(*) WHERE city = '...'` | **0.0804** | 0.2818 | 0.4351 | **3.5x** | **5.4x** |
| `LIMIT 10`, no sort | **0.0011** | 0.0029 | 0.0662 | **2.7x** | **60.9x** |
| `COUNT(*)` | 0.0256 | **0.0220** | 0.4005 | 0.9x | **15.6x** |
| `ORDER BY salary LIMIT 10` | 0.3440 | **0.3047** | 0.4197 | 0.9x | **1.2x** |

pandas is not in this table because it has no lazy API to compare against on equal terms; measured separately on the same `GROUP BY` and files, it takes 0.543426s at 2M rows and 6.720655s at 20M, so 39x and 60x. That margin says more about `read_csv` loading the whole file into a DataFrame first than about either engine.

The last two rows are losses to polars, stated because leaving them out would make the table a sales sheet. `COUNT(*)` is bandwidth-bound for both engines at this size: counting records means reading every byte and CSV carries no row count to shortcut to, so at ~0.026s for 711 MB there is nothing left to win. `ORDER BY ... LIMIT` is a draw after [#224](https://github.com/melihbirim/csvql/pull/224) pushed the limit into the sort workers; before that it was ~6x worse.

**Where the gap is widest: wide files.** csvql finds the fields a query names and skips the rest of each row, while a reader that materialises columns pays for all of them. 757 MB, 60 columns, `SUM` of one column at position 58:

| Engine | Seconds | vs csvql |
| --- | --- | --- |
| csvql | **0.0563** | 1.00x |
| polars 2.0 | 0.2187 | 3.9x |
| DuckDB | 0.5767 | 10.2x |

**Memory.** On aggregates csvql holds a running accumulator rather than a dataset, so peak memory is flat in file size. On the same 711 MB file, `GROUP BY department`: csvql **54 MB**, polars 2.0 **1110 MB**. This is a property of aggregate queries, not of every query: `ORDER BY` has to hold rows, and the same file peaks at 715 MB.

Reproduce with [`bench/bench_vs_polars.sh`](bench/bench_vs_polars.sh). Full working and the corrections to an earlier version of these numbers: [csvql vs polars](https://melihbirim.github.io/csvql/blog/csvql-vs-polars.html).

**NYC Taxi, 20M rows, 8 GB CSV** — raw CSV, no ingest, both engines: **~3.2x** faster, **~6x** less memory, and **0 bytes** of extra storage (DuckDB's fast path needs a 2.1 GB native store first).

## MCP Server

csvql ships as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, letting AI assistants (Claude, Copilot, etc.) query your CSV files directly.

```bash
csvql --mcp
```

### Why query instead of paste?

A 1 MB CSV costs **~560,000 tokens** to paste into an LLM — it doesn't even fit a 200K-token context window. Pasting a real dataset is impossible past a few hundred KB, and expensive long before that. With `csvql --mcp` the agent *queries* the file instead and gets back only the rows it asked for:

| CSV size | Paste into context | Query via `csvql --mcp` | Savings |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------- |
| 1 MB     | 559K tokens ❌ *(overflows)* | ~540 tokens | **1,000x** |
| 10 MB    | 5.6M tokens ❌      | ~550 tokens | **10,000x** |
| 100 MB   | 55M tokens ❌       | ~565 tokens | **98,000x** |
| 417 MB   | 230M tokens ❌      | ~560 tokens | **~410,000x** |

The query cost is **flat** — it's the SQL plus a few result rows, independent of file size — so a 417 MB file costs the same ~560 tokens as a 1 MB one. Five real questions, answered against DuckDB's NYC-taxi data; token counts via `tiktoken` (exact `cl100k`). Reproduce: [`bench/bench_tokens.py`](bench/bench_tokens.py). Your data never leaves your machine.

### Exposed Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `csv_query(sql)` | Execute any supported SQL query, returns results as JSON |
| `csv_schema(file)` | Column names and sample rows for a CSV file |
| `csv_list(directory?)` | List CSV files in a directory |

### Supported Queries via MCP

`csv_query` accepts the full SQL dialect supported by csvql. You can ask your AI assistant things like:

| Natural language prompt | SQL sent to `csv_query` |
|---|---|
| "Show me the top 10 customers by revenue" | `SELECT customer, SUM(revenue) AS total FROM 'sales.csv' GROUP BY customer ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10` |
| "How many orders per month in 2025?" | `SELECT STRFTIME('%Y-%m', order_date) AS month, COUNT(*) AS orders FROM 'orders.csv' WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31' GROUP BY month ORDER BY 1` |
| "How long does delivery take on average?" | `SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF('hour', shipped_at, delivered_at)) AS avg_hours FROM 'orders.csv' WHERE delivered_at != ''` |
| "Flag orders where picking exceeded SLA" | `SELECT order_id, DATEDIFF('minute', ordered_at, picked_at) AS mins FROM 'orders.csv' WHERE picked_at != ''` (scalar functions in WHERE not yet supported — filter by `mins > 90` in your shell) |
| "Add 2-day estimated delivery to shipments" | `SELECT order_id, DATEADD('day', 2, shipped_at) AS est_delivery FROM 'orders.csv' WHERE shipped_at != ''` |
| "Which employees have no department?" | `SELECT name FROM 'employees.csv' WHERE department IS NULL` |
| "List all cities, deduplicated, sorted" | `SELECT DISTINCT city FROM 'data.csv' ORDER BY city` |
| "Average salary by department, only > 80k avg" | `SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal FROM 'data.csv' GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 80000 ORDER BY avg_sal DESC` |
| "Join orders with customers, filter by region" | `SELECT o.id, c.name FROM 'orders.csv' o JOIN 'customers.csv' c ON o.customer_id = c.id WHERE c.region = 'West'` |
| "Salaries in range 50k–70k" | `SELECT name, salary FROM 'data.csv' WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000 ORDER BY salary` |
| "Employees not in London or Paris" | `SELECT name, city FROM 'data.csv' WHERE NOT city IN ('London', 'Paris')` |

**Full WHERE clause support:** `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`

**Full SELECT support:** column projections, `AS` aliases, `DISTINCT`, `COUNT`/`SUM`/`AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`VARIANCE`/`STDDEV`/`MEDIAN`/`GROUP_CONCAT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY` (by name, alias, or position), `LIMIT`, `STRFTIME()`, `DATE_PART()`, `JOIN`, `UPPER`/`LOWER`/`TRIM`/`REVERSE`/`LENGTH`/`SUBSTR`/`REPLACE`/`SPLIT_PART`/`GREATEST`/`LEAST`, `ABS`/`SIGN`/`CEIL`/`FLOOR`/`MOD`/`ROUND`/`TRUNC`/`SQRT`/`POWER`/`LN`/`LOG`/`EXP`, `COALESCE`, `CAST`, `DATEDIFF`, `DATEADD`, `EXTRACT`

### Setup

**One command (recommended)** — registers csvql in Claude Code and Claude Desktop, no manual config:

```bash
csvql install          # add --print to dry-run first
```

It runs `claude mcp add` for Claude Code (if the CLI is present) and merges an `mcpServers.csvql` entry into the Claude Desktop config, preserving your other servers. Restart Claude afterward.

**Claude Desktop (one-click)** — grab the `csvql-<platform>.mcpb` for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/melihbirim/csvql/releases) and open it in Claude Desktop (Settings → Extensions). No terminal. Build it yourself with [`scripts/build-mcpb.sh`](scripts/build-mcpb.sh).

<details>
<summary>Manual config (if you prefer)</summary>

**VS Code (Copilot)** — create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "csvql": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/csvql",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "csvql": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/csvql",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant to query CSV files directly:
> *"What are the top 5 product categories by revenue this year?"*

### Remote & on-prem: query data where it lives

Big files are hard to download — so run csvql **on the server next to the data** and connect over SSH. Only the SQL query and the small result cross the wire; the data never leaves the box. No open port, no reverse proxy — it rides your existing SSH keys and audit trail:

```jsonc
// client MCP config — csvql runs on the remote server
{ "command": "ssh", "args": ["analyst@dataserver", "csvql", "--mcp", "--root", "/data"] }
```

**`--root` sandboxes file access.** With `--root /data`, queries can only read files under `/data` — `SELECT * FROM '/etc/passwd'` and `../` traversal are rejected. Always set `--root` when exposing csvql to an agent or another user. Pair it with a restricted OS user and a read-only mount for defense in depth.

**Read-only by construction:** csvql only runs `SELECT` — it has no `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`DROP` and cannot modify your data. It makes zero outbound network calls and runs fully air-gapped. Full posture and hardening guidance in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Language Libraries

csvql ships as a native library for Python and Node.js — same SIMD engine, same performance, no subprocess.

```bash
pip install csvql-query          # Python: csvql.query(), .query_df(), .query_csv()
zig build node -Doptimize=ReleaseFast   # Node.js: require('csvql-query')
```

Full API, options (delimiter/comment/skip-empty-lines), memory comparisons against `csv-parse`/`papaparse`, and a runnable ETL example: **[docs/NODE.md](docs/NODE.md)** · **[docs/PYTHON.md](docs/PYTHON.md)**.
